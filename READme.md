## Installation
1. Clone code and run npm install. 2. Run 'mysql -u root -p' to open mysql shell in terminal. 3. In mysql shell run 'source db/schema.sql' to create the database. 4. Exit mysql shell and run 'npm run seed' to seed database.5. Run 'npm start' to start server.

## Usage
APi routes can be used to add, delete, or update items from the database. Routes can be tested with insomnia. To use in an actual retail setting database would need to be seeded with retailer's actual inventory and connected to a front end.
